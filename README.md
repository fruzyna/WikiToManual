# WikiToManual
Converts a cloned or downloaded Github wiki to a single PDF using \_Sidebar.md

## Building a PDF
\_Sidebar.md is a required file as it determines the order of the files in PDF creation. To run simply call python(3) convertWiki.py [wiki directory]. A markdown and PDF file combining all of the wiki will be created in your current directory.

[See here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#cloning-wikis-to-your-computer) for how to download a wiki.
